# Firefox-hardened
Firefox for Linux with custom build parameters and more. Can only be used with a custom memory allocator like [hardened_malloc](github.com/grapheneos/hardened_malloc), as `jemalloc` is removed.

The config flags are taken from various sources, including [Mercury](https://github.com/Alex313031/Mercury). Experimental optimization options are included but disabled.
